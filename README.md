Project Description: 
In the context of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, cardiovascular disease stands prominent. Detection in the incubation stage is essential for effective intervention. This study aims to improve the classification accuracy of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into four different cardiac conditions using machine learning techniques. ECG signals are converted to images and pre-processed before being classified. Preprocessing involves reshaping and standardising an image into a particular format. The proposed solution uses pre-trained models like ResNet-18, VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-Large, and GoogLeNet to detect patterns in data and trains accordingly. The dataset is classified into 4 categories (abnormal heartbeat, normal heartbeat, history of myocardial infarction, and myocardial infarction). Each category is labelled before it's fed to the model for training. This research involves the digital classification of ECG signals and assorting the best CNN model with higher accuracy.
